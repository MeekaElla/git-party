* "Glad to learn the Forking workflow! Encountered some possible use scenarios aside from those discussed while doing the exercises as well. The Git Party website is a good reference after this session. :)" - [Jeri Medrano](https://github.com/jerixmx)

* "I was able to learn a lot more on this Git Party than on my own! Also, Git, why didn't I met you in College? You could have saved me from anxiety over managing my capstone project. Now I'm excited to contribute more to the community!<3 " - [Alyssa Melody](https://github.com/alyssamelody)
