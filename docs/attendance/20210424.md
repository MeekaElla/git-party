Hi, Git party participants! Add your name here (with a link to your GitHub account) together with a short but interesting fact about yourself.

* [Alysson Alvaran](https://github.com/alyssonalvaran) - I am mixed-handed or cross-dominant. I write with my left hand but I do everything else with my right! :)

* [Meeka Ella](https://github.com/MeekaElla) - I'm nocturnal. I'm awake at night and asleep by day.

* [Jeri Medrano](https://github.com/jerixmx) - I do 3d printing and 3d modeling! I'm at a crossroads, but I'll be fine!
